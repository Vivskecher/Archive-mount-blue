Better ways to communicating with others.

A way to resolve differences peacefully

Arise two fundamental questions
    1.What is alive in you?
        What are you feeling
    2.What would make life more wonderful?
        Do you have any unfulfilled needs?

When people think they are expressing feeling when they are 
expressing an opinion , a criticism, a moral judgement.
