Manage Energy Not Time ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

manage your energy not your time

time management may seem like the right solution
 when you can get everything you need done

but it won't help if you're exhausted energy is 
the feeling of capability 

goals dreams and fulfillment give you ============ motivational energy 
trust friends and family give you ================ emotional energy 
mindfulness experiences and knowledge give you === intellectual energy
sleep recovery and exercise give you ============= physical energy

------------------------------------- NOT THE CORE
[you've probably come across personal development and
self-help books that talk about the importance of motivation and life goals
these things are important but they are not the core if you are tired on a
physical level you don't have the energy for big emotional or intellectual
challenges physical recovery is a science nobody talks about only
professional athletes know how important]
------------------------------------- CAR ANALOGY
it is think of your body as a car you use to move through life it's the only
car you have you can't sell it and get another one how far you get in life and how quickly
you can get there depends on how well you take care of your car if you're not
scheduling regular oil changes and maintenance you'll find yourself in
disrepair want to avoid a breakdown here are some tips first our body is designed
to move which is why studies show that

1.  we think better when we exercise without exercise your car rusts when it rusts
    you feel unmotivated and exhausted 
2.  our body is not designed to work for eight hours straight you need to take 
    15-minute breaks every hour if you do a ton of intellectual labor eat or go 
    for a walk during breaks if you do manual labor eat or take a break to think 
3.  sleep is the absolute minimum you owe your body every day when
    you sleep your body recovers so you can get things done
    4. fuel you know that you can't put just any kind of fuel or engine oil in
    your car do you really think your body is okay with junk food and soda your
    body needs the kind of fuel it was designed for water nuts fruits
    vegetables fresh meat and fish don't just eat for yourself eat to take care
    of your body and your brain
5.  tired it always means one thing you have to give your body a chance to recover
    what's the best way to do this remember that proper recovery is always
    active not passive most people want to sit on the couch and watch TV but this
    kind of rest won't give your body what it needs take a walk in the park get a
    massage hit up a yoga class or meditate.

it's important to find something that works for you use stress and energy
measurements to track an experiment with different recovery techniques taking
care of your car always requires getting up and doing something like taking it to
the repair shop or the car wash the same applies to your body trust us it will pay off
