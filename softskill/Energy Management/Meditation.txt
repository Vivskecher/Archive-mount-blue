Calm minds ::::::::::::::::
Do nothing.

10 minute breathing meditation :::::::::::::::
    Deep breathing
    absorb the weight
    All attention to body
    attention to breathing
    natural and relaxed
    follow the breathing
    pay attention to Inhale and exhale

when distracted pay attention
    and come back attention to breathing
    bring back attention to touch of body to seat
    and open your eyes.
