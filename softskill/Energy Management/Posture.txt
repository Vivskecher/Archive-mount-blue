Sitting is Bad for You::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

but the longer you stay put the more agitated your body becomes it sits

there counting down the moments until you stand up again and take it for a walk.

bodies love to sit 
right not really sure
sitting for brief periods can help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise 
nowadays our lifestyles make us sit much more than we move

around and our bodies simply aren't built for such a sedentary existence 
in fact just the opposite is true 

the human body is built to move and you can see
    structured inside us are over 360 joints
    about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy fluid motion 
    the body's unique physical structure gives us the ability to stand up straight 
    against the pull of gravity 
    our blood depends on us moving around to be able to circulate properly 
    our nerve cells benefit from movement and 
    our skin is elastic meaning it molds to our motions so with every
    inch of the body is ready and waiting for you to move.
    
    
what happens when you just don't 
    let's start with the backbone of the problem 
        our spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs 
        that sit between them joints muscles and ligaments 
        that are attached to the bones hold it all together 
        
            a common way of sitting is with
            a curved back and slumped shoulders a
            position that puts uneven pressure on
            your spine over time this causes wear
            and tear in your spinal discs overworks
            certain ligaments and joints and put
            strain on muscles that stretch to
            accommodate your backs curved position
            
            this hunched shape also shrinks your
            chest cavity while you sit meaning your
            lungs have less space to expand into
            when you breathe that's a problem
            because it temporarily limits the amount
            of oxygen that fills your lungs and
            filters into your blood 
    
    around the skeleton are the muscles nerves arteries
    and veins that form the body's soft
    tissue layers the very act of sitting
    squashes pressurizes and compresses and
    these more delicate tissues really feel
    the brunt have you ever experienced
    numbness and swelling in your limbs when
    you sit in areas that are the most
    compressed your nerves arteries and
    veins can become blocked which limits
    nerve signaling causing the numbness and
    reduces blood flow in your limbs causing
    them to swell
    
    sitting for long periods
    also temporarily deactivates lipoprotein
    lipase a special enzyme in the walls of
    blood capillaries that breaks down fats
    in the blood so when you sit you're not
    burning fat nearly as well as when you
    move around what effects does all of


this stasis have on the brain
most of the time you probably sit down
to use your brain but ironically lengthy
periods of sitting actually run counter
to this goal being stationary reduces
blood flow and the amount of oxygen
entering your bloodstream through your
lungs your brain requires both of those
things to remain alert so your
concentration levels will most likely
dip as your brain activity slows

unfortunately the ill effects of being
seated don't only exist in the
short-term recent studies have found
that sitting for long periods is linked
with some types of cancers and heart
disease and can contribute to diabetes
kidney and liver problems 

in fact
researchers have worked out that
worldwide inactivity causes about 9% of
premature deaths a year that's over five
million people so what seems like such a
harmless habit actually has the power to
change our health but 

luckily the
solutions to this mounting threat
are simple and intuitive when you have
no choice but to sit try switching the
slouch for a straighter spine and when
you don't have to be bound to your seat
aim to move around much more perhaps by
setting a reminder to yourself to get up
every half hour but mostly just
appreciate that bodies are built for
motion not for stillness in fact since
the video is almost over why not stand
up and stretch right now treat your body
to a walk
it'll thank you later
