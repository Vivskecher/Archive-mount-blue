Active Listening:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
The act of fully hearing and comprehending the 
meaning of what someone else is saying.

-avoid getting distracted
-focus on speaker and topic
-try not to interrupt
-let them finish and then respond
-key openers
-listen body language
-take notes
-paraphrase to make sure 

Reflective Listening:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Reflective listening is a communication 
strategy involving two key steps: seeking to 
understand a speaker's idea, then offering
 the idea back to the speaker, 
to confirm the idea has been understood correctly. 

=mirroring
=paraphrasing

"reconstruct what the client is thinking and feeling
 and to relay this understanding back to the client"

 Reflective listening is a more specific strategy than 
 the more general methods of active listening.

To allow the speaker to 'hear' their own thoughts and to 
focus on what they say and feel.
To show the speaker that you are trying to perceive the world as they 
see it and that you are doing your best to understand their messages.
To encourage them to continue talking.
