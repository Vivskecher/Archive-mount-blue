Create a permission system for the current project. 
Ensure that the previous tables for permissions are 
upgraded to the new format that you are using. 
Create a new module to check if a particular user has the permissions or not. 
Fit this into the old module so that the existing code does not break. 
Once done, create a form on the frontend to add permissions for a particular user. 
This form should only work when the user is an admin.
